    <div class="Contents">
      <p>As a broker associate with Resident Realty, I have very minimal overhead, eliminating the wasteful overhead costs
      that associates from other brokerages have. This allows me to pass those savings onto you through my reduced commision.</p>
      <p>I learned a long time ago that when you use your business to help people, your business will prosper.</p>
      <p>When you list your home with me, you're well on your way to keeping more of your home's equity. I charge a 1% selling
      agent commission, plus an agreed upon commission paid to the real estate agent representing the buyer of your home.
      (Typically the buyer's agent commission is 2.8%)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I follow the same steps in selling your home as other broker associates. 
        Same service, same contracts, just at a better price.</li>
        <li>It takes the same paperwork for a $150,000 home as it does for a $700,000 home.</li>
        <li>I provide a "cancel at any time" policy in every listing agreement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here is an example of the savings you can expect:</p>
