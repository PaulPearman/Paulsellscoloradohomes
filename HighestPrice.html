      <h3 class="PageTitle">Getting the Highest Price in the Shortest Time</h3>
      <div class="Contents">
      <p>In order to get the highest price in the shortest time, you need to know how to market your home. 
      The better you market your home, the more offers you will get. And the more offers you get, 
      the more choices you have to get the price and terms you want.</p>
      <p>The most important factor of marketing your home is pricing it right. 
      Your price should be adjusted to reflect the market and your property’s worth. 
      The key is to get as many people as possible checking out your fairly priced property. 
      If your property is not priced fairly, there will be no buyers because your price is set too high.</p>
      <p>Another important factor is the condition of your home. Make sure that your home looks ready to be sold. 
      Fix any defects (peeling or faded paint, cracks, stains, etc.) Condition alone can sometimes prompt 
      fast buying decisions. Not only should you fix any defects, but consider upgrading your home by making 
      major repairs and cosmetic improvements before selling. A nice looking home triggers the emotional 
      response that can lead to a financial response.</p>
      <p>Learn how to negotiate the best terms for all parties involved. Terms are another factor that may be 
      adjusted to attract buyers. If you insist on getting your asking price, think of what you can offer to the buyers. 
      For example, improvements you’ve made or even offering seller financing at a lower than market interest 
      rate on a portion of the sale price. Convince them why they should be paying the price you have set.</p>
      <p>Lastly, get the buzz out about your home. List your house with a hot agent that ensures your house 
      is listed on the MLS and on the internet. On your own, get the word out. It should always be visible 
      to passersby that your house is for sale, whether it is through signs, local advertisements or you telling friends, 
      family, and acquaintances.</p>
