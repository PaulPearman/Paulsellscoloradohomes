                            <h3>A home is not a home because of its room dimensions or the color of its walls.</h3>
                            <p>It's about how you feel when you walk through the front door, 
                            and the way you can instantly envision your life unfolding there</p>
                            <h3>This is more than just real estate. This is your life and your dreams.</h3>
                            <p>I take a different approach to real estate, one that is built on personal touches, 
                            win-win deals, and positive results.
                            <br>I utilize the latest technologies, market research and business strategies to exceed your
                            expectations.
                            <br>But more importantly, I listen, and that means I find solutions that are tailored to you.
                            <br>Thanks for starting your real estate search with me. This website is full of information for
                            you, whether you are looking to buy or sell.
                            <br>I value honesty – so I treat people honestly.
                            <br>I appreciate quality service – so I work to make sure my service is quality.
                            <br>I resent feeling overcharged – so I make sure my fees are reasonable and fair.
                            <br>I don't claim to provide excellent service. But my clients do.</p>
