          <h3>A home is not a home because of its dimensions or the color of its walls.</h3> 
          <p>It is about how you feel when you walk through the front door,
          <br>and the way you can instantly envision your life unfolding there.</p>
          <h3>This is more than just real estate. This is your life and your dreams.</h3>
          <p>I take a different approach to real estate, one that is built on personal touches,
          <br>win-win deals and positive results.</p>
          <p>I utilize the latest technologies, market research, and business strategies
          <br>to exceed your expectations.</p>
         <p>More importantly, I listen, and that means I find solutions that are tailored to you.</p>
         <p>Thank you for starting your real estate search with me. This website is full of information for
         you, whether you are looking to buy or sell.</p>
         <h3>I value honesty – so I treat people honestly.</h3>
         <h3>I appreciate quality service – so I work to make sure my service is quality.</h3>
         <h3>I resent feeling overcharged – so I make sure my fees are reasonable.</h3>
         <h3>I don't claim to provide excellent service. But my clients do.</h3>
