      <div class="Contents">
      <p>If you know exactly why you are selling, then it is easier for you to follow the 
      right plan of action for getting what you want.</p>
      <p>If you are a seller who needs to close a sale as quickly as possible, 
      then you should know that getting the highest price possible is not one of your priorities. 
      It does not mean that you can't or won't get the highest price, but it means that the price 
      is not the deciding factor. A buyer who can give you a quick closing time will appeal much more 
      to you than a buyer who can offer you more money at the risk of the negotiation and closing time dragging on.</p>
      <p>Itâ€™s always good to know how low you will go, in terms of selling price. 
      This will help to eliminate some of the offers that you find simply offensive or ridiculous. 
      Even though you should consider all offers seriously and take into consideration the terms of each offer, 
      sometimes if you know the bottom line and are strict about it, you can save yourself time.</p>
      <p>Once you know what your limits and reasons are, discuss them with your agent so that they can 
      help you set your goals realistically. If you decide to list your home on your own, make sure you do 
      research on the current market, and you get the proper advice you need in terms of legal issues, etc. 
      The key is to be realistic and to know what your goals are so they can be met.</p>
